<h2>Software, Applications, Modifications & License</h2>

<p>MediaFire Services may include special applications, application programming interfaces, installable software, or developer resources you can download and install on your desktop, mobile phone or other devices with Internet capability to enhance your ability to interact and benefit from the Services (“Software”).    This Software may require periodic modifications/updates, which may occur automatically or require you to initiate them.   The Software is a copyrighted work of MediaFire and is governed by the terms of this Agreement.  MediaFire grants you a “Limited License” to use the Software solely to interact with the Services.</p>

<p>When you download and/or use the Software, you accept this Limited License. MediaFire grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free limited license to use the Software on any device you own or control.  This Limited License is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by MediaFire, in the manner permitted by this Agreement.

<h2>MediaFire Premium Accounts - Payment, Renewal and Cancellation</h2>

<p>Premium Services (“Subscription”) require you to pay a fee, which is described in greater detail below.  You agree to pay all fees and charges you incur, in US dollars with a major credit card accepted by MediaFire.  Subscription fees are non-refundable except as expressly set forth below.  You hereby authorize us to charge your credit card to pay for the ongoing cost of Subscription.  Payment for the appropriate Subscription and/or Services will be made by automatic charges to your credit card.  Upon its expiration, your Subscription will be automatically renewed for a term (1) equal to the original subscription term or (2) in accordance with the terms of a special subscription offer (“Promotion”), and continually renewed for equal terms thereafter, unless you terminate your Subscription pursuant to the process set forth below.  You acknowledge and agree that the authorization to charge your credit card for our Subscriptions shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of the Services.</p>

<p>The billing period ends each term on the anniversary of your activation date. You agree to pay all fees and charges that you incur through your account, including, but not limited to, applicable taxes.  You will be responsible for charges for any products or services that you purchase that are offered for sale through our Services.  In addition, you are responsible for paying any amounts billed to your credit card by someone who uses your card, such as a secondary card holder or family member, or if you authorized use of your card by someone else for the initial Subscription. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your payment is returned to us for any reason, including chargeback, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your account and our obligations under this Agreement.  If you provide us with a new/updated card and are successfully charged, your renewal period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.</p>

<p>PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE RENEWED AT THE THEN CURRENT NON-PROMOTIONAL FEE. SOME YEARLY PLANS, WERE OFFERED FOR THE INITIAL 12 MONTHS ONLY AND MAY BEGIN BILLING MONTHLY STARTING THE 13TH MONTH AFTER SIGNUP. From time to time, we may offer different subscription plans and the fees for such plans may vary.   A detailed description of current premium services and features can be found on the Product Matrix page or by contacting Customer Service.</p>

<p>Business services offer "Rollover Bandwidth". Unused bandwidth in each billing period will become available in subsequent billing periods, without time limitations for usage. If you upgrade your plan, you will be billed immediately for the new plan and any unused bandwidth from your previous plan will be rolled over into your new plan. Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased for immediate use, which qualifies as Rollover Bandwidth. This one time purchase is not a recurring charge and will not affect the pricing of your Subscription service. You may view your billing history from your My Account page.</p>

<p>Pro services will be allocated 500GB of total storage, and a minimum of 1TB of bandwidth every 30 days, based on your initial subscription date.  Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased.  If you have less than 1TB available at the beginning of the next 30 day period, your bandwidth will be automatically increased to 1TB.   If your account is in excess of 1TB, bandwidth will not be added or deducted

<p>Bandwidth in a premium account is consumed by anyone, including you, who download your file(s). From your My Account page, you may view stats about your bandwidth usage.</p>

<p>You may cancel a Subscription at any time through your My Account page. Your account will remain active for the remainder of the term for which you have previously paid after which it will revert to a standard free account and be subject to the restrictions of a free account. Cancellation of your Subscription will not relieve you of any obligations to pay accrued charges, including any prorated charges accrued for the billing cycle in which your Subscription is cancelled.  We are not responsible for any accounting errors or oversights older than sixty (60) days.  MediaFire may, without compensation or proration, cancel your Subscription in the event of nonpayment or dispute of payment or if you violate any terms or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p><em>Which means:  Your credit card will automatically be charged for renewals.   Promotional and some yearly subscription plans, at renewal, are billed monthly at the then current fee.  You can cancel at any time from your account, or contact customer service.   You can buy an upgraded account or services.  Bandwidth is used by anyone downloading your Content.</em></p>

<h2>Refund Policy:</h2>

<p>MediaFire may approve a thirty (30) day money-back guarantee, after a review of Services utilized, which would apply only to the initial charge of your first Subscription with MediaFire. The guarantee does not apply to re-established subscriptions, changes in subscriptions or creations of subsequent subscriptions.  Your account will then revert to a free account and be subject to the restrictions of a free account.</p>

<p>REFUND REQUESTS should be submitted to MediaFire by email at <a class="pig_latin" href="ailtomay:efundray@ediafiremay.omcay">efundray@ediafiremay.omcay</a>.</p>

<p><em>Which means:  First time users may request a refund of their first month Subscription fee and be converted to a free account user.</em></p>

<h2>As-Is Services</h2>

<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MEDIAFIRE, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND YOUR USE THEREOF.</p>

<p>NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY PROVIDER OF ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT WARRANTS THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT. BOTH THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY THIRD PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR CONTENT OR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD THROUGH THE SERVICES.</p>

<p>NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY THIRD PARTY WARRANT THAT ANY FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES.

<p>FOR CLARITY, MEDIAFIRE ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT, (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF OUR SERVICES, (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN, (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR SERVICES, (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJANS, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY, AND/OR (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE SERVICES.

AS WITH THE PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH ANY MEDIUM OR IN ANY ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND EXERCISE CAUTION.</p>

<p><em>Which means:   Standard contract capitalized language.   Internet services are great but nothing is perfect and we’re not responsible if something goes wrong.</em></p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>NEITHER MEDIAFIRE NOR ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL MEDIAFIRES AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN MEDIAFIRE AND YOU. IN STATES, COUNTRIES OR TERRITORIES NOT ALLOWING EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, MEDIAFIRE AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.</p>

<p>The Services are controlled and offered by MediaFire from its facilities in the United States of America. MediaFire makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</p>

<p><em>Which means:  Also standard contract capitalized language.    This clarifies that we limit our responsibility if something goes wrong.</em></p>

<h2>Indemnity</h2>

<p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold MediaFire and its affiliates, and both MediaFire and their respective officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, information providers and licensors harmless from and against any and all claims, liability, losses, damages, obligations, costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by any MediaFire Party in connection with any Content or use of the Services, whether via your password and/or by any other person, whether or not authorized by you. MediaFire reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with MediaFire's defense of such claim. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the Services.</p>

<p><em>Which means:  If we get in trouble because of something you did or should have done, you’ll defend us in court or help us defend ourselves.</em></p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Legal</h2>

<p>The Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by MediaFire without restriction.</p>

<p>The Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and MediaFire each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Harris County, Texas ("Courts") with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to the Agreement or to the Services and /or Content and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding; additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts.</p>

<p>These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by MediaFire on the Services, the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

If any provision of the Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances.</p>

<p>YOU AND MEDIAFIRE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
