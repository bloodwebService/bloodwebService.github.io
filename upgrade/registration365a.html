<p></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p></p>

<p>MediaFire recognizes and believes that data privacy is essential to all Internet users, and the privacy of your personal information is of the utmost importance to us. We are committed to providing you an experience that is safe, secure, and trustworthy. Part of this commitment means safeguarding and respecting your privacy and your choices.</p>

<p>This Privacy Notice explains what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it, in addition to information on disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information.</p>

<p>Because we’re a technology company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. This Privacy Policy gives you an overview of all possible situations in which we could interact together. Of course, all situations may not apply to you.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our Terms of Service, collectively referred to as the "Agreement", governs your use of the MediaFire website, Content, apps, software, products, applications, tools and services provided to you on, from, or through the MediaFire website or platform regardless of how your access or use them (collectively, the "Services").  Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Services. “User”, “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting MediaFire’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.  “We”, “Us”, and “Ourselves” refers to MediaFire. “Party”, “Parties”, or “Us”, refers to both you and ourselves.  It doesn’t matter if the words are capitalized or not.  If you choose not to accept this Policy, please do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business.</p>

<p>All topics are covered in greater detail below.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p></p>

<p>We want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to you, our legal basis, your rights and the choices that are available to you.</p>

<h2>This Privacy Policy incorporates:</h2>
<p></p>

<ul style="list-style: initial; margin: initial; padding: 0 0 0 40px;">
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Better navigation and user-friendly language. To make the policy easier to understand, we use clear, plain language and examples that illustrate our activities.</li>

	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Insights into how we acquire your information and how it is used.</li>

	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">More control over your information. We provide intelligence on how you can control the information you provide to us. Our policy explains how you can make choices about your information, and the measures we’ve put in place to keep your information secure.</li>

Many users have access to our services through their organizations (e.g., their employers), who control their accounts or use of our Services.

<h2>What is Personal and Non Personal Information?</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information, commonly referred to as PII, is information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online or device identifier, an identification number, or location data such as your IP address.  In relation to your interaction with MediaFire, personal information, for example, may include information you may purposefully provide such as your name and email address during account registration or your address and financial information if you make a purchase.   By visiting our website, we automatically collect your IP address.  Upon your request and in order for us to download or distribute any Content uploaded by you to MediaFire, your files become published Content and cannot be considered personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Non-personally identifiable information cannot be used to identify or locate an individual person.  Examples are: hashed/anonymized/pseudonymized data, click stream information, browser type, demographics, time and date, which advertisements are clicked or scrolled over and other data of interest.</p>

<p>We will not share personal information about you or any of your Content with any third parties except as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

<h2>Who We Get Information From and How Your Information Is Used</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you visit MediaFire.</p>

<p>We use your personal information to fulfill our commitment to you and provide you with our Services.  In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make our Services relevant, interesting and personal to you.  We balance our interests with your rights.</p>

<p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any choices you have made about information you provide.</p>

<p>Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect from and about you.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">You give us information yourself voluntarily, when you:</p>

<ul style="list-style: initial; margin: initial; padding: 0 0 0 40px;">
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Create and update an account
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">In order to use certain features, you need to create an account with us. We ask for the bare minimum amount of necessary information - your name and email address, a user ID selected by you, and a, hopefully, complicated and very secure password. Then we assign you a unique identifying number in our database.</p>
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">We use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to communicate with you.  Communications may be to onboard you to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.  Or, to send you administrative messages and information, notifications about changes to our Services, and updates to our agreements. Additionally, communications could be about Service features, updates, security alerts, technical notices, support and administrative messages, surveys, offers, promotions, events, and provide other news or information which may interest you or other similar messages.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Make a purchase
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">If you purchase a subscription or add-ons, you must provide certain payment and billing data to our payment processing partners, including your name, credit card information, billing address, and zip code. We do store purchase history, billing, and payment confirmation information.  We’ll email you invoices confirming your purchase<p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Contact us directly
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">If you contact us for support or to report a problem or concern (regardless of whether you have created an account), we collect and store your messages, and other data about you like your name, email address, location, operating system, IP address, and any other data you provide or that we collect through automated means (which we cover below). We use this data to respond to you and research your question or concern.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Interact with our ads
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Our advertisers gather information when you click on or tap ads or watch videos.</p>
 
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">The information is used to show you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you and to tailor advertisements across your various devices.  Studying ad results helps us make decisions about our customers advertising preferences.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Add names and email addresses to share folders and files
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">To use these features, you provide names and email addresses in order to enable the functionality of the features.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Add people or designate an administrator or billing representative for a business account
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Companies purchase seats on their account for employees or business associates and provide names and email addresses for the person ‘occupying’ each seat purchased.  By necessity, each business account will need to provide contact information for their account administrator and, if different, a billing representative.  If you are an individual registered user and the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is owned by your employer and was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and your organization wishes to establish a business account, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator or group of users.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Share your information from other companies, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">You may allow transmission of your personal information from companies like these, which may be controlled in the settings of each website, not by MediaFire.   MediaFire does not ask for information about you.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Provide information at an event we sponsor or participate in
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your name, contact, and possibly other information, may be recorded on our servers.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Your administrator integrates our Services with other services you use
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">To do this, you will need an account.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">File a DMCA claim with us
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">When you file a DMCA claim, you provide information about who you are. All the info will be kept on our servers.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">You must accept our agreements in order to use our Services and we record your clicked acceptance.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Apply for a job
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">When a person applies for a job with MediaFire thru our website, all information is recorded and maintained on our servers.   Applications received in person or by mail will be manually processed and your name and contact information will be entered into forms stored on our servers.</p>
	 </li>

</ul>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Our systems and/or third parties may automatically obtain information:</p>
<p></p>

<ul style="list-style: initial; margin: initial; padding: 0 0 0 40px;">

	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;"> Third-party platforms you connect with
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">An example would be logging into MediaFire from Facebook.   We need to ensure it’s you, so information is passed to us.  You should review the privacy policies of every website you visit.  Websites use cookies to track users and gather information. </p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Information about your device(s)
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Information about your IP address, device make, model, operating system, version, and data connection type, and platform, in addition to other specifications and information will be automatically gleaned during contact with our Services. </p>
 
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to provide updates and other relevant messages related to our Services. These may include information and in-app messages about, new services, new features, etc.</p>
 
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Devices are discussed in more detail below.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">When you upload, download, collaborate, share files or otherwise interact with our Services
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">These actions also are subject to the next point below – ‘When you interact with our website or mobile app or API’.</p>
 
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission for others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your company administrator (if applicable) select.  Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.   Under certain circumstances, when you share a file, your display name and profile picture may be displayed on that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.  You can confirm whether certain information is visible from within the Services by contacting us or your administrator (if applicable).  Please be aware that any Content posted, including information about you, by you or anyone with access to the Content, that Content may be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">When you interact with our website or mobile app or API
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">MediaFire is always looking for ways to make our Services smarter and faster, and more innovative and useful to you.  We use collective learnings about how people use our Services so we may identify areas for integration and improvement, and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot our Services.</p> 
 
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">To that end, when you interact with us, or really any technology service today, information is gathered to help us fulfill our commitments to you to provide and protect our Services and you.  To do that, we need:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Information about your behavior on MediaFire:</b> including, login details, date/time of visits, page view data, URL of the Web page you visited before navigating to us, referring/exit pages, click data, features you use, types of advertisements you interact with, duration of your visit, the sizes and names of the files or folders you upload, download, share or access.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We use this information to personalize and improve our Services, by analyzing who we appeal to, activity patterns and trends, develop new products and services, and test and analyze new features by providing features to some users before rolling the feature out to all users. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature, we can understand which version is better. </p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Information about your devices</b> plus your browser information, browser history, IP address, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use, your geolocation and system configuration information is recorded. </p>
 
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This information can help us identify unique users across multiple devices so we can monitor and analyze traffic and trends and track usage and activities in connection with our Services.  We use general location information to provide country based advertising (e.g. US-based advertising, if you are in the US).  We also perform studies necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our site and mobile applications, monitor and improve the information security, and to facilitate the Services’ technical functioning, including troubleshooting and resolving issues.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Information may be used as required or permitted by law, or as we, in our sole discretion, otherwise determine to be necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our users, employees, third parties, the public, or our Services.</p>
	 </li>

</ul>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Other companies give us data:</p>
<p></p>
<ul style="list-style: initial; margin: initial; padding: 0 0 0 40px;">

	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;"> We may collect info from third party services we contract with
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing and fraud detection, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.  We select only well-established and trusted service partners to access information about you to perform services on our behalf.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Information related to your use of third-party services
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</p>

	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Have you ever searched for information on a mailbox and then when you visit other websites you see ads for mailboxes?  We contract with advertising companies that will use your previous search history and clicks to provide advertising of specific interest to you.  Your interests and interactions with ads are not stored on our servers, but we do benefit from this practice.   After all, ads help support our website and the experience should be of interest to you.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">When you engage in an online survey initiated by us
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third-party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve our users, as a whole, by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications and/or promotional activities, and innovations in products and other service offerings we might contemplate.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">From a social media website
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">We allow you to use social media sites to create your MediaFire account, sign in to us, or to connect your account with the social media site.  Social media sites may give us automatic access to certain personal information retained by them about you (e.g., content viewed by you, content liked by you, and information about the advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on, etc.).</p>

	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">To sign in from a social media website, such as Facebook or Twitter, information is shared between us to authenticate your identity.  Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you or the platform or service decide to give us.  The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.</p>

	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">If you click on a link provided via a social media plugin, you are voluntarily establishing a connection with that respective social media site.  Services, like Facebook, give you the option to post information from your account with them.  The social media features on our website, like the Facebook Like Button, may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things, such as, your IP address and which page of our Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature (e.g. Like Button). Your interactions with these features are governed by the social media’s own privacy policy.</p>
 
	 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">You should be aware that any information you provide on social media websites, community forums and publicly accessible blogs, including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information, may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.  Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.</p>
	 </li>

</ul>


<h2>Device Information</h2>
<p></p>

<p>We automatically receive certain types of information when you install, access, update, or use our Services. This information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's unique identifier, manufacturer and model, operating system and version, screen size and resolution,  mobile network  and status (WiFi, etc.), application version including installation and updates info, settings, and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.  
</p>
<p>We use this information to determine what types and version of devices, etc. are accessing our Services.  After all, we have to write software to accommodate various platforms, versions, etc.   We have to keep up and necessarily sunset unused code.
</p>






					<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of the MediaFire Services, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage and disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.  Information may be collected from you in various ways when you use our Services.  We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, apps, services and communications.  This information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's IP address, access times, your browser type and language. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and accessed pages.  Personal and non-personally identifiable information from collected data may be shared with third parties who work on our behalf to provide your services.  These third-party services and unique identifiers may be used to contact you, measure usage and analyze trends, administer the website and collect information for its databases. For example:  <a href='http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/' target='_blank'>Google Analytics Privacy Policy</a>.</p>



<h2>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</h2>
<p></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">What are they?</style></p>

<p>When you interact with people, it’s nice when they remember you, your relationship and what you like.  That ‘feel good’ experience has been extended to your interactions with websites.</p>

<p>Like most browsers and websites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files saved on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our site, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p>

<p>MediaFire and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons when you access and use our Services. These tools are essential to enable the Services to provide the features you have requested, such as remembering you have logged in. These tools also automatically track and collect certain system data and usage data when you use our Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through these tools to other data that we collect.</p>

<p>These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device.  The specific names and types of cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers, and similar technologies used to collect and manage information may change from time to time. In order to help you better understand our use of such technologies, we have provided the some terminology and definitions.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Cookies</span> are mutually beneficial small text files, which often include a unique identifier, placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. They are commonly used to remember where you were during your session with a website.  They can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites.  Cookies allow us to recognize you, remember things about your visits, make our site easier to use, see which areas and features are popular and count visits to our website.  Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. There are several types of cookies:</p>

<ul style="list-style: initial; margin: initial; padding: 0 0 0 40px;">
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow sites to link your actions during that particular browser session.  They help with navigation on a website and are enabled by default.
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Persistent cookies are stored on your device and record information, allowing sites to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites. They remain until you manually delete them or until they expire.
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">First-party cookies are created by the website you are visiting and are necessary to keep track of your personal preferences and the current session.  Most web browsers enable first-party cookies by default. If you were to disable first-party cookies, a website could not keep track of your activity as you move from page to page.
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting.  These are commonly used for advertising, analytics, etc.
	 </li>
	 <li style="display: list-item; margin-bottom: 20px;">Flash cookies aka Local Shared Objects (“LSO”) are a small file stored on your computer by a website that uses Adobe’s Flash player technology.  Information stored on a Flash cookie is available to all browsers and is considered a security issue.  When you delete or clear cookies from your browser, you will not necessarily delete the Flash cookies stored on your computer.  MediaFire does not use Flash cookies.
	 </li>
</ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Web beacons</span> are small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behavior.  There are myriad ways in which they can be used.  For example, a third-party tracking site can determine how much merchandise was purchased for a particular banner ad campaign. In scenarios such as these, the individual users may still remain anonymous, even though their buying habits are disclosed.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Mobile device identifiers</span>  - When you access mobile applications, companies don’t have access to traditional browser cookies to track you over time. Instead, third party advertising and analytics companies use device identifiers, such as Apple iOS’s Identifiers for Advertisers and Google Android’s Advertising ID, to monitor the different applications used on a particular device.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Device fingerprinting</span> can track devices over time, based on your browser’s 
configurations and settings. Because each browser is unique, device fingerprinting can identify your device, without using cookies. Since device fingerprinting uses the characteristics of your browser configuration to track you, deleting cookies won’t help. Device fingerprinting technologies are evolving and can be used to track you on all kinds of internet-connected devices that have browsers, such as smart phones, tablets, laptop and desktop computers. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">HTML5</span> has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins. It does everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to build incredibly complicated applications that run in your browser.  And, it can generally be used as an alternative to Adobe Flash.  It isn't proprietary and it is cross-platform, which means it doesn't care whether you're using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or ultrabook or a Smart TV.  If your browser supports HTML5, it should work flawlessly.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Why does MediaFire use these technologies?</span></p>
<p>MediaFire and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience, increased functionality and to recognize you across different services and devices.</p>

<p>We use these cookies both when you visit our site and Services via a browser and our mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.</p>

<p>Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. They are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant and targeted ads. We use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent). You are free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device allows this, but if you disable them, then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable.  You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.</p>

<h2>MediaFire Premium Accounts - Payment, Renewal and Cancellation</h2>

<p>Premium Services (“Subscription”) require you to pay a fee, which is described in greater detail below.  You agree to pay all fees and charges you incur, in US dollars with a major credit card accepted by MediaFire.  Subscription fees are non-refundable except as expressly set forth below.  You hereby authorize us to charge your credit card to pay for the ongoing cost of Subscription.  Payment for the appropriate Subscription and/or Services will be made by automatic charges to your credit card.  Upon its expiration, your Subscription will be automatically renewed for a term (1) equal to the original subscription term or (2) in accordance with the terms of a special subscription offer (“Promotion”), and continually renewed for equal terms thereafter, unless you terminate your Subscription pursuant to the process set forth below.  You acknowledge and agree that the authorization to charge your credit card for our Subscriptions shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of the Services.</p>

<p>The billing period ends each term on the anniversary of your activation date. You agree to pay all fees and charges that you incur through your account, including, but not limited to, applicable taxes.  You will be responsible for charges for any products or services that you purchase that are offered for sale through our Services.  In addition, you are responsible for paying any amounts billed to your credit card by someone who uses your card, such as a secondary card holder or family member, or if you authorized use of your card by someone else for the initial Subscription. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your payment is returned to us for any reason, including chargeback, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your account and our obligations under this Agreement.  If you provide us with a new/updated card and are successfully charged, your renewal period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.</p>

<p>PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE RENEWED AT THE THEN CURRENT NON-PROMOTIONAL FEE. SOME YEARLY PLANS, WERE OFFERED FOR THE INITIAL 12 MONTHS ONLY AND MAY BEGIN BILLING MONTHLY STARTING THE 13TH MONTH AFTER SIGNUP. From time to time, we may offer different subscription plans and the fees for such plans may vary.   A detailed description of current premium services and features can be found on the Product Matrix page or by contacting Customer Service.</p>

<p>Business services offer "Rollover Bandwidth". Unused bandwidth in each billing period will become available in subsequent billing periods, without time limitations for usage. If you upgrade your plan, you will be billed immediately for the new plan and any unused bandwidth from your previous plan will be rolled over into your new plan. Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased for immediate use, which qualifies as Rollover Bandwidth. This one time purchase is not a recurring charge and will not affect the pricing of your Subscription service. You may view your billing history from your My Account page.</p>

<p>Pro services will be allocated 500GB of total storage, and a minimum of 1TB of bandwidth every 30 days, based on your initial subscription date.  Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased.  If you have less than 1TB available at the beginning of the next 30 day period, your bandwidth will be automatically increased to 1TB.   If your account is in excess of 1TB, bandwidth will not be added or deducted

<p>Bandwidth in a premium account is consumed by anyone, including you, who download your file(s). From your My Account page, you may view stats about your bandwidth usage.</p>

<p>You may cancel a Subscription at any time through your My Account page. Your account will remain active for the remainder of the term for which you have previously paid after which it will revert to a standard free account and be subject to the restrictions of a free account. Cancellation of your Subscription will not relieve you of any obligations to pay accrued charges, including any prorated charges accrued for the billing cycle in which your Subscription is cancelled.  We are not responsible for any accounting errors or oversights older than sixty (60) days.  MediaFire may, without compensation or proration, cancel your Subscription in the event of nonpayment or dispute of payment or if you violate any terms or conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p><em>Which means:  Your credit card will automatically be charged for renewals.   Promotional and some yearly subscription plans, at renewal, are billed monthly at the then current fee.  You can cancel at any time from your account, or contact customer service.   You can buy an upgraded account or services.  Bandwidth is used by anyone downloading your Content.</em></p>

<h2>Refund Policy:</h2>

<p>MediaFire may approve a thirty (30) day money-back guarantee, after a review of Services utilized, which would apply only to the initial charge of your first Subscription with MediaFire. The guarantee does not apply to re-established subscriptions, changes in subscriptions or creations of subsequent subscriptions.  Your account will then revert to a free account and be subject to the restrictions of a free account.</p>

<p>REFUND REQUESTS should be submitted to MediaFire by email at <a class="pig_latin" href="ailtomay:efundray@ediafiremay.omcay">efundray@ediafiremay.omcay</a>.</p>

<p><em>Which means:  First time users may request a refund of their first month Subscription fee and be converted to a free account user.</em></p>
